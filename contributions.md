|  1 |              **[Add favicon for `qute://` pages #3755](https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/issues/3755)**             |          Worked on, but not completed. Ended up being very difficult to find the dependencies / how the crucial ode interacted with other parts of the code or resources in order to trigger action and resolve the issue.         |                                       Still a work in progress.                                      |       Juan, Julian      |
|  2 |            **[Multiple Search Engines, One Command #2699](https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/issues/2699)**          |                                         Worked on. Mostly same as above. It was somewhat easy to start, but the solutions we kept coming up with fell short.                                          |                                       Still a work in progress.                                      | Julian, Juan |

Successful, issue seems to be resolved, so pull request submitted.                                                               | Completed, pull request submitted.

|  4 |            **[Updating CONTRIBUTING documentation #2851](https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/issues/2851)**           | Seemed like a good, code-light introduction to the project. After getting feedback, it was clear that we'd have to do more research in order to fulfill the contributions they were seeking (e.g., regarding tox, no familiarity). |                                             Put on hold.                                             |                 |
|  5 |            * [Add a versions.txt to windows releases #1212](https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/issues/1212)           |                        Considered this issue. Seemed pretty easy to get to work on, but by that time we had already found our own issues or been drawn to bigger issues, and so didn't end up working on it.                       |                                      Considered for the future.                                      |                 |

Wanted to work on it, but the maintainers said it was a bug they should fix and self-assigned.                                     |                                   Never got to work on.                                   |                 |

As a result, no work was done on it, and issue was closed.                         |                                               Non-issue                                              |                 |
