## CONTRIBUTING.md

### General
1. Be professional. We are in a student setting but practicing real life work.
2. Be respectful. Disagreements are bound to happen; try to find proactive solutions that are the ultimate best
for the product being built.
3. Be open to the ideas of others. (even if they are not a group member)
4. Be pragmatic.
5. Be ethical. For more info, search for the ACM/IEEE Code of Ethics.

#### Setup
1. Clone the repository to your local workspace. <br/> <br/>
2. Make your own branch and work on your branch.
3. Always make sure you pull for most recent updates before you start working each session

#### Coding Style
1. Comment as much as possible (and as much detail as possible)
2. We should be able to understand your code just from your comments

#### Commits and Pull Requests
Keep the commit log as healthy as the code. It is one of the first places new contributors will look at the project. <br/>

1. No more than one change per commit. There should be no changes in a commit which are unrelated to its message. <br/>
2. Keep the diffs as clean as possible. Avoid unnecessary line changes. <br/>

When filing a Pull Request, make sure it is rebased on top of most recent master. <br/>
