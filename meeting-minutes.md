# Documenting contributions/meetings:

### Meeting 1: Monday Mar 19, 2018:
  * Checked out approachable/beginner-friendly/Python open source projects.

  * Picked qutebrowser

### Meeting 2 (in class) Tuesday Mar 20, 2018:
  * Updated the projects page to reflect this week's milestones.

    * See [Sprint 0 Task Board](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s18/qutebrowser-team/projects/1) for this week's milestones (and progress))

  * Familiarized ourselves with the developer environment.
  * Familiarized ourselves with the contribution guidelines.
  * Looked at issues with an easy label

    * Reviewed closed issues which had had pull requests accepted as a model to follow.
    * Narrowed down and made a list of open issues which seemed approachable (easy label, low priority, stale, beginner-friendly).

  * Came up with a few issues we might consider posting (after we sure they're actually issues/haven't been addressed yet).

### Meeting 3: Monday Mar 26, 2018:

  * Updated the projects page to reflect this week's milestones.

    * See [Sprint 1 Task Board](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s18/qutebrowser-team/projects/2) for this week's milestones (and progress))
  * Went through the issues we identified and had discussion re: how we might go about solving each one.

  * Picked out first issue we wanted to focus on.

  * Made plan / divided work to go through code base so that we can possibly resolve the issue.

  * Took some time to confirm one of the issues we identified is a decent issue / has not been posted / made plan to post it.

### Meeting 4 (in class) Tuesday Mar 27, 2018:

  * Looked at the issues we decided to tackle first in detail.
    * Found that some of them had been fixed, but not closed, so we inquired about that (Juan commented specifically on the main issue we wanted to contribute to). It turns out there is still an area that hasn't been addressed and is open, so we're considering adding that to the agenda.

  * Got started on our plan B, which does require some coding, and which we found to be a really interesting and useful feature request. We all split up the code base to look for where the solution might be.
    * Ended up being harder than we expected. Resolving it is our main goal for our next weekly meeting on Monday, Apr 2.

  * Identified possible additional issues.

### Meeting 5 Monday Apr 2, 2018:

  * Rockney submitted an issue re: the lack of clear documentation for new contributors.
    * Got a welcome response, submitted pull request to fix the issue, got a positive response> They said they would shrink down the multiple commits to one and merge then.

  * Decided to work on [Issue #3755](https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/issues/3755) so we (Julian) commented asking if we could claim the issue.

  * Identified an issue where they give you the option to do something they can't do (i.e., if you have two windows you can move one tab to another, but you can't move a tab that's already there to your own). Wentao posted the issue.

  * Commented (√Ålvaro) on Issue [#2699](https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/issues/2699) asking to claim, and asking for help re: where to start fixing the issue. This is the issue we plan to spend the most time on together, as it requires significant familiarity with the code base and a decent amount of coding.

  * After receiving helpful feedback regarding the status of [Issue #2851](https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/issues/2851), we decided to actually go forward with working on this issue. Juan is taking a look at how to go about this and will take care of communication w/ the collaborators if there is any more confusion. The issue has to do with development environments/providing proper documentation for multiple development environments, which is one of our strengths.

  * Made a plan to test the success of the accepted pull requests (verifying they actually do what they set out to do).

  * Updated the projects page to reflect this week's milestones.

    * See [Sprint 2 Task Board](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s18/qutebrowser-team/projects/2) for this week's milestones (and progress))
